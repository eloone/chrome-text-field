## Pitch

Haven't you ever had ideas flying in your mind all day ? 
How should I name this new framework ? this new application ? how would its url look ?
Then you find yourself sketching stuff in a text editor and switching back all the time to your browser. 
What if you could do that right from your favourite browser ? Wouldn't it be marvellous ? 
Thanks to Text-Field you can do just that. It was made to capture your daydreams.
 
## Typical usage 

* Copy-paste text into it to unformat it.
* Write short text that you want to have at hand without having to open a text editor and switching to it every time you need it in your browser (ex. special characters, a url etc.).
* Whenever you have an idea, write it and capture it quickly to save it for later.
* Perfect for quick and volatile information.

## Features  

* The added text is saved and always available even when the popup is closed or if you disable and then enable again the extension or when you shut down your computer or your browser.
* The added text is destroyed when you hit the "clear all" link at the bottom, or when you remove all the text from the textarea yourself, or when you uninstall or remove the extension from chrome, those actions cannot be undone.
* The textarea auto expands when new content is added until it reaches its maximum size of 300px.
* The textarea initially has the size of its content or its maximum size of 300px.
* The cursor always points to the first line of the textarea.
